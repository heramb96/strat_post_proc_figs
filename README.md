This provides the post-processing MATLAB scripts used to obtain the figures.
Figure 2 shows the meridional velocity pseudocolor plots.
Figure 3 shows the fft of vertical velocity for different stratification and at two depths.
Figure 4 plots the vertical velocity pseudocolor plots and vertical profile at a particular y location.
Figure 5 plots the horizontal kinetic energy and the flux from the mixed layer base.
